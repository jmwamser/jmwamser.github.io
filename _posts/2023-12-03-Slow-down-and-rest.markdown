Starting a new routine can be a lot, especially when you have a busy mind that has several ideas. It’s easy to lose focus and be all over the place, in doing this also making life feel more stressful. This is where I am at, I have decided I need change. I need to lean more into my faith and truly start listening to what’s going on. When I say listening I don’t just mean hearing the sounds, I mean really taking the time to understand what’s being said. This is an easy thing to forget to do without realizing it. 

How did I come to this and see that I was just hearing and not listening? Well… life recently has been a roller coaster and I have been ignoring my emotions. The one thing that I really shouldn’t do. That’s a convo for another time though. In finally seeing that I have been over anxious with so many ideas and feeling like nothing was getting done. I said what am I doing different? Well it’s my morning routine, I’m getting up last minute and going to be last minute. I was rushing to get ready and get the kids out the door. Mind you sleep to me just doesn’t always make sense. Yes I get you need it to function but that’s time I could be doing other stuff. With this logic though that’s how I got where I’m at. Always going and going and never stopping and as my grandparents would say “smelling the roses”. 

Today marks the day this all changes. Here is my plan:

- be the first up and get ready
- spend time in my Bible
- meditate 
- study new coding content (working on a certification)
- help family get ready for the day. 

All these things are in a time block between 2hours to 2 1/2hours. 

This morning I accomplished this goal. Also having time to make this post as well. If I’m able to keep up the timing I’ll be posting as well. 

Now, the bigger part of this post was to share what made me hear I needed to slow down. Well in meditation today I was on listening and heard “slowdown rest” looking up I saw the beauty of the sun rising up behind the dormant trees. I just sat in awe over the sight. It’s been way too long since I just enjoyed the view of the sun rise. 

My hope and wish for you is that you take the time as well. Don’t get stuff in accomplishing things and then forget to enjoy the journey. Truly the journey is where the joy is. 

Have a wonderful day,
